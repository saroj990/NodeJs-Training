Final Assignment:

After the closure of the session, each attendee have to go through a fairly small assignment which will be reviewed and evaluated later to check the code quality.

The final assignment is supposed to have only working API end points and there will be no views involved.

NOTE: 
Attendees can use PostMan or PostWoman or some sort of tool to make sure that all the end points are working as expected before submitting the assignments for review. 

Attendees can use Github for their assignments and each repo has to have README.md file listing down what API endpoints has been used for the assignment .


These are points that has to be checked or looked for while reviewing the final assignments.

    • Proper indentation and comments.

    • Code should be modular and reusable

    • Assignment should be in working condition when submitted for review

    • Code should be uploaded to github repo

    • Unit testing for at least one module

We are looking forward to starting the session from 22nd June onwards.
